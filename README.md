# Associative-Arrays
Maria Rodriguez
Mini Project 4: Associative Arrays

In this project, I created a class named AssociativeArray that creates an array of <Key, Value> pairs. The class
uses methods such as get(), set(), remove(), size(), hasKey(), clone(), etc. Please review the documentation in
the code to see how each method works! In the Experiments file, you can see each method in action.
